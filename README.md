# RedisBase

RedisBase is a project aimed at recording my progress while following the tutorial available at [build-your-own.org/redis](https://build-your-own.org/redis/).

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind RedisBase is to provide a practical learning experience. I am interested in database development, networking basics, and C/C++ programming.
